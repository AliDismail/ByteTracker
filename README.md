In the Spring 2025 semester, I attended the Data Structures and Algorithms lab at LAU. As part of our final project, we had the opportunity to build a full-stack application and as a team, we chose to create something practical and impactful for our campus community.

**ByteTrackers** is a full-stack website designed to help students at LAU Byblos easily report and retrieve lost items. Whether it’s a misplaced laptop or a forgotten textbook, ByteTrackers makes it simple to log, search, and recover belongings through a user-friendly interface tailored to campus life.

## features


### Report "lost" items
Users can easily report items they've lost by submitting a detailed entry that includes the item's description, last known location, picture (optional) and time of loss. These entries are added to the "Lost" pool, making them searchable and increasing the chances of recovery through community awareness.

### Report "Found" Items
When someone finds an item that appears to be lost, they can log it into the system with relevant details such as photo, location found, date of finding it, and a description of the item adding them to the "Found" pool. This shared database helps match lost items with their rightful owners.

### Search for "Lost/Found" Belongings
The platform features a powerful search tool that allows users to filter by  location, date, and keywords. Whether you're trying to find your own item or return one you've found, the search makes it fast and intuitive.

### Help Return "Lost" Items to Their Owners
Once a match is made, ByteTrackers facilitates secure communication between the finder and the owner via the registered email. This ensures a safe and respectful exchange while protecting user privacy.

## Conclusion
This project offers university students a secure and reliable platform to easily find and return their lost belongings.
Whether it’s a textbook, wallet, or laptop, students can report lost items, search for found items, and connect with others in a safe and efficient way.
